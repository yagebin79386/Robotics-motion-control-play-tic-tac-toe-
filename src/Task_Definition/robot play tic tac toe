1. The assecorries demanded: the Dobot machine, the suction cup, the photoelectric sensor, the button, for red and blue each 5 cubes of it,
the color sensor, 9 squre grid 

2. You need to write the code to let the robot firstly check if the other robot is at home (through photoelectric sensor check), and then if
you press the button, the robot starts to move out from base to check the chessboard and do the chess drop.
So the robot need to identify which square is taken, by which party and then makes its decision to make the move and the move back to the 
base just like how we play the tic tac toe.
