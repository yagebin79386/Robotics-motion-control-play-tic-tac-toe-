# Robotics-motion-control
Doing the exercise to understand the robotic motion's principle and learn about different plants and end effector. Trying with python script and blocky to program the motion of the Dobot and all its end effector to achieve different simulated tasks

# Preparation steps before you can reproduce the tasks
1. own a Dobot robot machine Version 1 or Version 2 for disposal.
2. own different end effector (the accessary to somulate different motoric movement of an industrial robot)
2.1 The Photovoelectric Sensor, The suction Cup, the conveyor, the color sensor, the pen holder, the button.
2.2 Sticky band, sponge cubes in at least blue, green, red color, and 5 pieces at least for each color, the white paper, the pastic holders.
3. install the Dobot SDK on Windows system, please check the seperate file "Install the Dobot SDK on Windows"

## The task definition
It can be found in the folder "src/task definition", which gradually increase the dificulty, the final step is to program with Python to let robot play tic tac toe game.
## The coding solution
The script corredponsind each task write with python can be found in the folder "src/motion_control".
